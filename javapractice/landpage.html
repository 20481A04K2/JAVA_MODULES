                    Best Coding Practices for Hassle-free Programming
                </h1>

                 <p>
                    Just like with any other activity, the world of coding is also governed by informal rules. Most of
                    these rules are formulated over decades. Programming languages often remain in usage for longer than
                    their founders expect.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for different purposes. Thus, some
                    static do’s and don’ts are always of use in the fluid zone called coding. Normally, a great code has
                    three common features: maintainability, dependability, and usability. It should also be adaptable
                    enough to be efficient even in changing environments.

                <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>

                <p>
                    This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of these, a code may be inefficient even
                    if it is completed. The prerequisites that need to be in place for an efficient code covers matters
                    like design and architecture. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once these are met, it becomes easier to follow some established good coding practices.

                <!-- Bullet points  -->

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>COMMENTING</h3>
                        <p>
                            Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes
                            that are written by multiple programmers. However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge
                            transfer.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h3>
                        <p>
                            Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding. Often developers use Y1 or X1
                            as variables, and then do not replace them with meaningful names.
                        </p> 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
                        <p>
                            Once the code has been written, it has to be deployed. The installation files should be kept
                            to a minimum and updated regularly.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The best practices for coding are, most of all, designed to reduce risk whenever there are chances
                    of it. For a beginner, a few of these will not be completely applicable.
